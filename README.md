# Emergency-Helpline-Website
A Helpline Website made using PHP, CSS, MySQL which provide address and contact numbers of nearby Hospital, Police Station, Fire Station, Power Station and Child Information in case of any emergency. I have personally used Macromedia Dreamweaver MX, Wamp Server, MySQL and phpMyAdmin Software and server to build this interactive application.
